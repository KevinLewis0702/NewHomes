The legal basis for processing

Under Data Protection Law, different grounds are considered as a ‘legal basis for processing’. The determination of the legal basis for processing should be made by the Data Controller.

Where NewBuildHomes acts as the Data Processor, the legal basis is typically determined by the Customer. In most situations, the legal basis is:

‘processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest’

When NewBuildHomes takes the role of the Data Controller, the following legal bases for processing are commonly used:

‘processing is necessary for the purposes of legitimate interests pursued by the controller’ (examples of these legitimate interests include understanding how customers use our products to improve them, providing information to help businesses comply with legal obligations, reducing financial risks, offering marketing solutions to support business growth, and protecting our business from financial losses).

'processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party or in order to take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract' (such as registering new customers, maintaining relationships, delivering products and services, and communicating about these offerings).

'the data subject has given consent to the processing of his or her personal data for one or more specific purposes' (as seen when asking users to participate in surveys, offering recommendations and suggestions, or when users voluntarily provide data for specific purposes).

It is important to note that depending on specific circumstances, the legal basis might vary. However, NewBuildHomes always operates in full accordance with Data Protection Law, ensuring that data is processed based on a fair and justified legal basis.




How we share your personal data
NewBuildHomes collects business information from third parties (see section 5), which may include personal data, for the purposes of providing business products and services. NewBuildHomes may share your this data with outside organisations such as service providers and regulators. This section lists the different types of organisations NewBuildHomes may share your personal data with.

Cliens and suppliers with whom NewBuildHomes enters into an agreement with to provide business information or commercial data.

Regulators or law enforcement agencies where NewBuildHomes is required to do so.

Professional advisers where it is necessary for us to obtain their advice or assistance, including lawyers, accountants, IT or public relations advisers.

Debt collection agencies where it is necessary for NewBuildHomes to recover money.

Payment processing agents where it is necessary for NewBuildHomes to protect a transaction.

With third parties and their advisers where those third parties are acquiring, or considering acquiring, all or part of NewBuildHomes.

NewBuildHomes will not disclose or sell your personal data which you have provided to us by means of explicit consent to clients or marketing agencies.


Transferring personal data outside the European Economic Area ("EEA")
In certain circumstances NewBuildHomes may share your personal data with third parties situated in countries outside the EEA. When NewBuildHomes transfers your personal data out of the EEA, it will ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it, by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:

The country that we send the personal data to is approved by the European Commission as providing an adequate level of protection for personal data

The transfer is to a recipient in the United States of America who has registered under the EU/US Privacy Shield

The recipient has entered into European Commission standard contractual clauses with NewBuildHomes

You have explicitly consented to the transfer of your personal data
